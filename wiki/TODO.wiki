It's a temporary place for some ideas, they are moved then to [http://code.google.com/p/betting-ai/issues/list Issues].

  # MarketSimulator - consider leaving 1 cpu free, it's difficult to get to the box, which uses 100% of cpu.

  # Optimise trader using kelly criterion (market level or global?).

  # ITrader.init(ctx), ctx is used inside epn publisher, which is passed to ctx.registerEpn, it works only because trader context object is the same for the whole live cycle of a Trader, maybe it's better to create a new context every time trader.execute method is invoked, or change publisher(epn) to publisher(epn,ctx) to inject ctx to publisher?

  # MarketService.placeBet. The placeBet method returns Bet object with userId = -1, either different object without userId should be returned, or calling bet.userId should throw UnsupportedOperationException.

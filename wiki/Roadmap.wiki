Betting AI version 1.0 ( RELEASED on 16 June 2010)

    * Goal - Proof of concept. Run market simulation for very simple market data that contains a few events to create market and place/cancel bets. Simulation will be executed for simple trader implementation that places a bet if price is bigger than 2. 

    * Scope - http://code.google.com/p/betting-ai/issues/list?can=1&q=milestone%3DRelease1.0&colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Complexity+Milestone+Owner+Component+Summary&cells=tiles

Betting AI version 1.1 (RELEASED on 23 July 2010)

    * Goal - Run market simulation for simple trader implementation (place bet if price>2) and real market data. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Betting AI version 1.2 (RELEASED on 24 November 2010)

    * Goal 1 - Run market simulation for simple AI trader and real market data. 
    * Goal 2 - Improve performance of market simulation.
    * Goal 3 - Code review of releases 1.0,1.1,1.2, refactoring.
    * Goal 4 - Add more market/bets data to runner context, e.g. traded volume, runner  
prices,etc.
    * Goal 5 - Generate html reports for market simulation with some useful graphs.

Betting AI version 1.3 (release planned on 30 February 2011)
    * Integrate market simulator with complex event processing (Esper) to calculate some metrics, e.g. derivatives or to recognize patterns
    * Proof of concept. Create and test trading strategies adopting meta-heuristics (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9734814-essentials-of-metaheuristics)
    * Improve performance of Betex

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future
    * More metaheuristic optimisation, evolution algorithms, genetic programming, cooperative evolution.
    * Visualisation of trader optimisation.
    * Proof of concept. Create and test trading strategies adopting AI (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/391010.Introduction_to_Neural_Networks_with_Java)
    * Compare efficiency of trading strategies between meta-heuristics and simple AI (back propagation)
    * Web interface to Market Simulator.
